## **ðŸŽ¯ The Agentic Shift: From AI-Assisted to True Agentic Experiences**

### **The Problem: Current Designs Feel Like AI-Assisted Tooling**

The current Agent Desktop interface suffers from fundamental design flaws that prevent it from achieving true agentic experiences. The G2 Grid layout feels like a traditional data display rather than an intelligent collaboration environment. The three-panel design forces advocates to constantly switch context between customer information, chat interface, and AI analysis, creating cognitive overload that impedes decision-making.

Information architecture problems compound these issues. The interface displays twenty-five or more data points simultaneously without clear hierarchy, making everything appear equally important. Advocates spend two to three minutes processing information before they can make confident decisions, while customers wait impatiently for responses. The AI provides suggestions but doesn't act autonomously, requiring advocates to manually process every transaction and execute every action.

This creates a trust deficit where AI shows ninety-two percent confidence while dumping comprehensive analysis on advocates who must then interpret and act on the information. The result is decision paralysis from too many simultaneous choices, with advocates doing tactical work instead of providing strategic oversight. There are no clear agentic behaviors or autonomous AI actions that would transform the experience from AI-assisted to truly agentic.

### **The Solution: True Agentic Experiences**

True agentic experiences require a fundamental reimagining of the human-AI relationship. Autonomous AI agents work independently on assigned tasks, providing real-time processing with visible progress indicators that build trust through transparency. These agents execute actions automatically with human approval checkpoints, enabling proactive problem identification and resolution rather than reactive responses to advocate requests.

Human advocates evolve from manual processors to strategic overseers who focus on decision-making and customer relationships. Clear approval and rejection workflows for critical actions ensure human authority is maintained while enabling AI to handle computational complexity. This creates a symbiotic relationship where AI handles tactical execution while humans provide strategic wisdom and empathy.

The orchestration becomes seamless through three-way conversations between advocates, AI agents, and customers. Multi-channel communication orchestration enables consistent experiences across email, SMS, chat, and voice interactions. Real-time status updates and progress tracking provide advocates with confidence in AI actions, while ambient AI integration makes the technology feel natural rather than intrusive.

## **ðŸŽ¨ Design Strategy: Three-Panel to Two-Panel Layout Transformation**

### **Current Three-Panel Layout Problems**

The existing three-panel layout creates significant cognitive challenges for advocates. The left panel displays customer information and transaction details, the center panel contains the chat interface and conversation flow, and the right panel shows AI analysis and recommendations. This arrangement forces excessive context switching as advocates must constantly scan across three different areas to gather the information needed for decisions.

The information architecture compounds these problems by displaying too many data points simultaneously without clear hierarchy. Decision paralysis results from competing priorities that all appear equally important. Advocates spend two to three minutes processing information before they can make confident decisions, creating stress and uncertainty that impacts both advocate satisfaction and customer experience.

The three-panel approach treats AI as a separate tool rather than an integrated partner, creating a disconnected experience that feels more like traditional software than an intelligent collaboration environment. The visual complexity of multiple competing elements creates mental fatigue from constant eye movement and attention shifting, preventing advocates from focusing on what matters most.

### **Future Two-Panel Layout Solution**

The new two-panel layout creates a focused environment that supports rapid decision-making while maintaining access to all necessary information. The left panel, occupying one-third of the interface width, serves as the context and decision support area. It contains a customer context card with essential information at a glance, a transaction context card with key details and status, an AI analysis summary with real-time risk assessment and recommendations, and quick action buttons for primary decisions like approve, deny, or escalate.

The right panel, occupying two-thirds of the interface width, serves as the conversation and workflow area. It contains the chat interface for customer conversation with ambient AI assistance, inline AI suggestions with approve, edit, or reject options, visual workflow progression indicators, and a message input area where advocates can respond with AI copilot assistance.

This layout transformation reduces cognitive load by eighty percent, moving from twenty-five or more data points to five core decision elements. The progressive disclosure approach shows only essential information by default while making detailed analysis available on demand through interaction. This enables advocates to make confident decisions in five to ten seconds rather than two to three minutes.

### **Design Transformation Principles**

Progressive disclosure becomes the foundation for managing information complexity. The interface shows only essential information by default, including the customer request, AI recommendation, confidence level, and primary action buttons. Detailed analysis, customer history, and alternative options become available only when advocates request additional context. This approach supports a clear decision-making hierarchy where the most important information appears first.

Decision-first design prioritizes information needed for immediate decisions while eliminating elements that don't support the decision-making process. Clear action buttons with confidence indicators guide advocates toward appropriate responses, while the elimination of unnecessary information reduces noise and complexity. This creates an environment that supports rapid decision-making without sacrificing access to detailed information when needed.

Ambient AI integration makes the technology feel natural and contextual rather than separate and intrusive. AI assistance appears inline with conversation rather than in a dedicated panel, creating a seamless experience where AI feels like a collaborative partner rather than a tool. Real-time processing with visible thinking indicators builds trust through transparency, while visual confidence indicators and clear reasoning help advocates understand AI recommendations.

The agent continuously monitors transactions and provides confidence scores that help advocates understand the reliability of recommendations.

The AI Communication Agent orchestrates multi-channel customer communication across email, SMS, chat, and voice interactions. This agent drafts contextually appropriate responses, sends status updates, and handles routine customer queries while maintaining professional tone and security protocols. Human oversight ensures message quality through review of tone and content, with approval required for sensitive communications.

The AI Research Agent handles blockchain transaction verification and customer history analysis. This agent checks transaction confirmations, verifies wallet addresses, analyzes patterns, and researches policy requirements and procedures. Human oversight validates unusual findings and approves research for high-value transactions while providing strategic context for complex situations.

The AI Progress Agent manages case progress tracking and workflow management. This agent updates case status, triggers notifications for milestones, and manages workflow escalations while providing human oversight through progress accuracy review and milestone achievement approval. The agent ensures smooth workflow progression while maintaining human control over critical decisions.

### **How Agents Help Advocates Make Better Decisions Faster**

The primary goal of understanding cases quickly transforms from a time-consuming process to an immediate insight. AI agents provide immediate context summaries that reduce decision time from two to three minutes to five to ten seconds. The information hierarchy prioritizes customer risk, transaction status, and AI analysis with clear visual indicators including status flags and confidence scores that build trust in AI recommendations.

Effective customer interaction becomes possible through AI-drafted responses that receive human approval before sending. This approach improves response quality by ensuring professional, consistent, and contextually appropriate communication while supporting multi-channel interactions from a single interface. Real-time AI assistance serves as a copilot for complex situations, enabling advocates to focus on relationship building rather than message crafting.

Informed decision-making results from AI analysis with confidence scoring that provides real-time fraud detection and pattern recognition. Action proposals come with automatic recommendations that include human oversight, while progress tracking provides visual workflow progression that helps advocates understand where they are in the resolution process. This creates confidence in decisions while maintaining human authority over critical choices.

Proactive customer protection emerges through AI agents that monitor and prevent fraud in real-time. Immediate scam pattern recognition enables one-click customer protection measures, while AI-assisted customer guidance provides education and support. This approach protects both customers and organizational assets while maintaining human oversight for sensitive situations.

## **ðŸ”„ Moving Repetitive Actions into Agentic Work**

### **Current Repetitive Tasks**

Advocates currently perform numerous repetitive tasks that consume time and mental energy without adding strategic value. Transaction checks require advocates to manually verify blockchain confirmations, a process that could be automated while maintaining human oversight for unusual patterns or high-value transactions. Customer information retrieval involves searching through multiple systems to gather relevant data, a task that AI agents could perform automatically while ensuring accuracy for sensitive cases.

Blockchain transaction analysis requires advocates to manually verify wallet addresses and transaction history, a process that AI agents could handle continuously while providing human oversight for approval decisions. Policy application involves manually applying policies and procedures to each case, a task that AI agents could automate while maintaining human approval for policy exceptions and edge cases.

These repetitive tasks create cognitive load that prevents advocates from focusing on strategic decision-making and customer relationships. The manual nature of these processes introduces delays that impact customer experience while creating stress and uncertainty for advocates who must process large amounts of information quickly.

### **Agentic Work Implementation**

AI agents can handle real-time monitoring of transactions and customer activity, providing continuous tracking that enables proactive problem identification. Pattern recognition capabilities allow automatic fraud detection and risk assessment that would be impossible for humans to perform consistently across all cases. Policy application becomes automatic with human oversight, while communication orchestration manages multi-channel message delivery.

Human oversight checkpoints ensure quality control while enabling AI autonomy. High-value transactions require human approval above certain thresholds, while risk escalation triggers human review for high-risk patterns. Policy exceptions and non-standard cases receive human decision-making, while customer complaints and sensitive situations maintain human intervention.

This approach creates a symbiotic relationship where AI handles computational complexity and routine tasks while humans provide strategic oversight and relationship management. The result is improved efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction while maintaining human authority over critical decisions.

## **ðŸŽ¯ The Transformation: AI-Assisted vs. Agentic**

### **Paradigm Shift Comparison**

The transformation from AI-assisted to agentic experiences represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how humans and AI collaborate. In AI-assisted environments, AI serves as an assistant that provides suggestions while humans remain the primary processors of information and executors of actions. The work distribution heavily favors humans, who perform ninety percent of the work while AI provides ten percent assistance through recommendations and analysis.

Agentic environments reverse this relationship, with AI agents performing ninety percent of the work autonomously while humans provide ten percent strategic oversight. AI becomes an agent that acts rather than an assistant that suggests, enabling proactive problem identification and resolution rather than reactive responses to human requests.

Decision speed improves dramatically, moving from two to three minutes in AI-assisted environments to five to ten seconds in agentic environments. Cognitive load reduces by eighty percent, from twenty-five or more data points to five core elements that support immediate decision-making. Information display transforms from showing everything simultaneously to progressive disclosure that reveals details on demand.

The layout evolves from three-panel grids that force context switching to two-panel focus areas that support decision-making. AI behavior changes from reactive suggestions to proactive actions, while the trust model shifts from data transparency to action transparency that builds confidence through visible reasoning and clear outcomes.

### **Decision-Making Transformation**

The decision-making process transforms from a manual, time-consuming activity to a collaborative, rapid process. In AI-assisted environments, advocates must manually check transaction details, research customer history, draft responses, and execute actions. This process takes five to ten minutes and creates stress and uncertainty as customers wait for responses.

In agentic environments, AI analyzes customer requests automatically and provides context summaries with recommendations. Advocates review and approve or reject these recommendations, after which AI executes the approved actions. This process takes five to ten seconds and creates confidence and satisfaction for both advocates and customers.

The transformation enables advocates to focus on strategic decision-making and customer relationships while AI handles computational complexity and routine tasks. This creates a symbiotic relationship that leverages the unique strengths of both human and artificial intelligence, resulting in superior outcomes for all stakeholders.

## **ðŸŽ¨ Key Design Principles**

### **Human-AI Symbiosis**

Human-AI symbiosis creates a collaborative environment where each participant contributes their unique strengths. AI handles computational complexity including transaction analysis, pattern recognition, and risk assessment that would be impossible for humans to perform consistently across all cases. Humans provide strategic oversight including decision-making, customer relationships, and empathy that AI cannot replicate.

This creates a clear division of responsibilities where AI performs tactical work while humans perform strategic work. Trust emerges through transparency as AI explains its actions while humans maintain control over critical decisions. The result is a partnership that achieves outcomes superior to what either humans or AI could accomplish alone.

### **Progressive Disclosure**

Progressive disclosure manages information complexity by showing only essential information by default. The interface displays customer requests, AI recommendations, confidence levels, and primary actions immediately while hiding detailed analysis, customer history, and alternative options until requested. This approach supports a clear decision-making hierarchy where the most important information appears first.

The technique reduces cognitive load by eighty percent, moving from twenty-five or more data points to five core elements that support immediate decision-making. This enables advocates to make confident decisions quickly while maintaining access to detailed information when needed for complex situations.

### **Ambient AI Integration**

Ambient AI integration makes technology feel natural and contextual rather than separate and intrusive. AI assistance appears inline with conversation rather than in dedicated panels, creating a seamless experience where AI feels like a collaborative partner rather than a tool. Real-time processing with visible thinking indicators builds trust through transparency.

The approach creates seamless conversation flow where AI responses appear inline with human communication rather than in separate areas. Visual confidence indicators and clear reasoning help advocates understand AI recommendations while maintaining human authority over critical decisions.

### **Decision-First Design**

Decision-first design prioritizes information needed for immediate decisions while eliminating elements that don't support the decision-making process. The interface displays customer information, AI recommendations, confidence indicators, and primary action buttons prominently while hiding supporting details until requested.
