## **üéØ 1. Agentic Overview: Where Agents Come Into the Advocate Experience**

### **The New Paradigm: Human-AI Symbiosis**

**Traditional Support Model:**
- Human advocates do 90% of the work
- AI provides 10% assistance (suggestions, recommendations)
- Advocates manually process every transaction, check every detail
- Cognitive overload from information processing

**Agentic Support Model:**
- AI agents do 90% of the work autonomously
- Human advocates provide 10% strategic oversight
- Advocates become "Air Traffic Controllers" for AI agents
- Cognitive focus on decision-making and customer relationships

### **Agent Roles in the Advocate Experience**

- Trust deficit - AI shows 92% confidence while dumping analysis

**3. Reactive vs. Proactive**
- AI waits for advocate requests
- Manual triggering of every action
- No autonomous decision-making
- Advocates still doing tactical work

### **Future State: True Agentic Experiences**

**What Agentic Tooling Looks Like:**

**1. Autonomous AI Agents**
